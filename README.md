# matplotlibExample
Matplotlib example plotting script. 

I have included the script, and three data files in order to create a nice figure.

You will need Python, NumPy, and MatPlotLib. If you are using Linux, it should be very easy to get all the packages you need. This link will provide you with all the information you need.

This is just the style I like to use. It's very clean, and great for publications. You will notice there is very little Chartjunk.

Can be edited very easily to suit your needs. For more information, and for more options, check out this website.

When saving the plot, I like to adjust the subplot param first (button next to the save button). I change left to 15 and bottom to 13. This just makes the axes a little more visible, otherwise sometimes they're cutoff.
