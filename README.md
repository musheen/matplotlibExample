# matplotlibExample
Matplotlib example plotting script. 

You will need Python, NumPy, and MatPlotLib. If you are using Linux, it should be very easy to get all the packages you need. 
This is just the style I like to use. It's very clean, and great for publications. Can be edited very easily to suit your needs.
